# Transport-Optimization

#Problem 1
Given the timetables of trolleybus arrival, there is  an algorithm to optimize the traffic from station È˜tefan cel Mare to station Circul. And also we can visualize the result. Finally the maximum interval between two trolleybuses became twice smaller than in the initial case.


#Problem 2
Given the timetables of trolleybus arrival, there is algorithm to optimize the traffic among all given stations.

#Problem 3
Given the passenger traffic load between two stations here is an algorithm that determines the number of trolleybuses of each type needed to satisfy the law obedient citizens' needs that use the public transportation,
considering that there can be max 70 people in a trolleybus.
